## Last updated: 2022-11-15

The Chrome Root Program policy defines the [minimum requirements](/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/) that must be met by CA owners for both initial and continued inclusion in the Chrome Root Store. Note that Google includes or removes CA certificates within its Root Store as it deems appropriate for user safety. The selection and ongoing inclusion of CA certificates is done to enhance the security of Chrome and promote interoperability; CA certificates that do not provide a broad service to all browser users will not be added to the Chrome Root Store.

The Chrome Root Program and corresponding Root Store processes applications and requests for changes through CCADB. CA owners who satisfy all of the Chrome Root Program policy requirements may initiate an inclusion request by:
- Today: first completing an “Add/Update Root Request” case in CCADB and emailing [chrome-root-program@google.com](mailto:chrome-root-program@google.com). Additional detail will be requested by the Chrome Root Program at the time of submission.
- Expected by end of calendar year 2022: Once available in CCADB, applicant CAs must submit a completed ["Root Inclusion Request"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tEM_K1VK6wKQdC9leV_v8kMhywRWMpkipuHIga9n7is/edit#slide=id.g16144f26865_0_671) case in order to be considered for inclusion.
