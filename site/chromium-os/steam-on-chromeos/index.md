## Game Developers

We’d love to work with you to ensure your games run great on Chrome OS. If your
game is already on Steam and runs on Linux (with or without Proton), you can try
it using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/14220699).
If you encounter Chrome OS specific bugs with your game, have particular workflows
you’d like supported, or are otherwise interested in working with us, please reach out
to borealis-game-dev@google.com.
